# gsheets-api
(In Progress) gsheets-api is an api that fetches spreadsheet data from spreadsheet and gives the response in a much more human readable format. Also, it has some optimised and easy to handle request payloads to be sent to the sheets api which is very useful and understandable for someone who is a novice at handling APIs.
